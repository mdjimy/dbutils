## dbutils

this is an attempt at a object-relational mapper and query builder that uses JPA annotations without the need of any compile time shenanigans and with mostly reasonable defaults.

### why bother?

i started this mostly out of lazyness. i didn't want the complexity of full blown JPA criteria, and i also wanted less magic than what spring data repositories do. for me, this library is a good balance between simplicity and minimizing boilerplate code. basically, once the entity is defined, the only thing i have to deal with the code to find specific entries (more on the pattern i use below).

this uses `java.sql.DataSource` and `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` from spring-jdbc, the annotations from `javax.persistence`, and plain reflection to do the actual mapping. it can currently map most standard field types (including enums).

### i have been using (and improving) it for quite a while now, and found it useful in many cases. if you use it, and find it useful too, that's even better.

### basic mapping

for a basic entity, extend `BasicGuidEntity` and annotate your class with `@Table` and `@Column` annotations:

```java
@Table(name="foo")
public class Foo extends BaseGuidEntity {

	/* no ID field, because the superclass has one already */
	
	/** no name in annotation => uses name of the field  **/
	@Column 
	private Date created;
	
	/** fieldname in db is different from fieldname in class  **/
	@Column(name="last_modified") 
	private Date lastModified;
	
	/** no annotation = no mapping **/
	private boolean bar;

	/**
	any getters and setters you want. dbutils modifies the fields directly 
	through reflection, so this can really be anything you want
	**/
	
}
```

### repository

With a basic entity like this, you can extend `AbstractGuidRepository` to have basic functionality:

```java

@Repository // add spring annotations if you want
public FooRepository extends AbstractGuidRepository<Foo> {

}
```

if you're using this from within springboot, this already has an `@Autowired` `DataSource` , otherwise you may have to instantiate a DataSource and wire it yourself.

this also comes with basic functionality, such as:

```java
public T get(String id) 
public T save(T object)
public T save(T object, String id) // saves under the given ID instead of generating one
public void delete(String id)
public void delete(T object)
```

The <T> here is your class, in this case "Foo", and the save method automatically determines if it is a new object (id is null) or an update to an existing one (id != null). this also comes with a bunch of hooks you can override:

```java
public void beforeDelete(T object)
public void afterDelete(T object)
public void beforeSave(T object)
public void afterSave(T object)
```

as well as the actual mapping- and unmapping methods:

```
public MapSqlParameterSource unmap(T object)
public T mapRow(ResultSet rs,int count)
```

these you can override to modify the objects before saving or after loading, e.g. to load child objects or encrypt / decrypt fields.

since this repository has no real idea of the object it is dealing with, listing functions are not included, except this:

```java
public List<T> find(String query, Map<String,Object> params)
```

this builds a `NamedParameterJdbcTemplate` from the given String with the given params, e.g:

```java

Map<String,Object> params = new HashMap<>();
params.put("updated", new Date());

List<Foo> foos = r.find("SELECT FROM foo WHERE update < :updated", params);

```

### querybuilder

#### SELECT

if you want to build simple queries, you can write them by hand, or possible use the `SimpleQuery` class, which basically removes the need to instantiate a separate map. the example above would be:

```java
SimpleQuery sq = new SimpleQuery("SELECT FROM foo WHERE update < :updated");
sq.put("updated", new Date());

r.find(sq.getSql(), sq.getParams())

OR

r.find(sq)
```

for anything more complicated, you can use the query builder. this is currently only implemented for MySQL, but it is pretty much standard SQL, and as long as you don't go nuts with it and/or use features that are potentially unsupported, this should be fine.

Here's a basic example (this starts a simple SELECT statement):

```
Select s = new MysqlStatementBuilder().createSelect();
TableReference tr = s.fromTable(Foo.class);

```


at this point:
```
s.getSql() ---> "SELECT * FROM `foo` `foo_1`"
s.getParams() ----> {}
```

#### WHERE

you can now add additional things: 

```java
Select s = new MysqlStatementBuilder().createSelect();
TableReference tr = s.fromTable(Foo.class);
		
Date d = new Date();
if(d!=null) {
	s.condition(Operator.AND, tr.field("updated"), Comparator.EQ, tr.value(d));
}
```

which would yield this:

```
SQL: SELECT * FROM `foo` `foo_1` WHERE `foo_1`.`updated` = :value_1
PARAMS: {value_1=Thu Oct 03 13:14:44 CEST 2019}
```

#### JOIN

or you can do a JOIN, such as this:

```java

Select s = new MysqlStatementBuilder().createSelect();
TableReference tr = s.fromTable(Foo.class);
		
JoinTable jt = tr.join(Bar.class);
		
jt.addOn(Operator.AND, tr.field("id"), Comparator.EQ, jt.field("foo_id"));
```

which leads to this:

```
SQL: SELECT * FROM `foo` `foo_1` JOIN `bar` `bar_1` ON `foo_1`.`id` = `bar_1`.`foo_id`
PARAMS: {}
```

#### CONDITIONS

you can also easily group conditions:

```java
Select s = new MysqlStatementBuilder().createSelect();
TableReference tr = s.fromTable(Foo.class);
	
Condition c1 = s.condition(Operator.AND);
		
c1.condition(Operator.OR, tr.field("id"), Comparator.EQ, tr.value("00000"));
c1.condition(Operator.OR, tr.field("id"), Comparator.EQ, tr.value("00001"));
	
Date tomorrow = DateUtils.addDays(new Date(), 1);
Date yesterday = DateUtils.addDays(new Date(), -1);
		
Condition c2 = s.condition(Operator.AND);
c2.condition(Operator.OR, tr.field("updated"), Comparator.GTE, tr.value(tomorrow));
c2.condition(Operator.OR, tr.field("updated"), Comparator.LTE, tr.value(yesterday));
```

which yields  this result:

```sql
SELECT 
	* 
FROM 
	`foo` `foo_1` 
WHERE 
	(
		( // this block is condition "c1"
			`foo_1`.`id` = :value_1 
			OR 
			`foo_1`.`id` = :value_2
		) 
		AND 
		( // this block is condition "c2"
			`foo_1`.`updated` >= :value_3 
			OR 
			`foo_1`.`updated` <= :value_4
		)
	)
```

### useful patterns

i am usually using this for things that involve REST APIs, and for this, i found the following pattern useful:

##### Controller 

a spring `@RestController` only serves as HTTP -> Service translation. for listing, i usually have a few common fields (such as "filter" for searching, applied to all fields that make sense, along with "order", "asc", "offset" and "max"). POST / PUT / DELETE and single GET methods are more or less self-explanatory, a list get would usually look something like this:

```java
@RestController
public class FooController {
	
	@Autowired
	private FooService fooService;
	
	@GetMapping(value="/foo")
	public List<Foo> list(
		@RequestParam(required=false) String parentId, 
		@RequestParam(required=false) Date before, 
		@RequestParam(required=false) Date after, 
		@RequestParam(default="name") String order,
		@RequestParam(default="true") boolean asc,
		@RequestParam(default="0") int offset,
		@RequestParam(default="25") int max
        ) throws AuthException, SqlException {
    
    	/**
        1:1 passthrough to service, for more complicated things,
        you could wrap this query in a "FooQuery"
    	**/ 
    	return fooService.list(parentId,....,order,asc,offset,max);
	}
}
```

##### Service

deals with any kind of business logic, and especially authorization (if applicable). again, the simple CRUD methods are trivial, listing could be:

```java
@Service
public class FooService {
	@Autowired
	private FooRepository fooRepository;

    @GetMapping(value="/foo")
    public List<Foo> list(
    	String parentId, Date before,Date after, 
    	String order,
        boolean asc,
        int offset,
        int max
        ) throws AuthException, SqlException {

		if(!checkAuthorization()) {
			throw NotAuthorizedException()
		}

		return fooRepository.list(parentId,....,order,asc,offset,max);
    }
}
```
##### Repository

this deals with building the appropriate SQL and loading the object. The important distinctions here is that

the `createSelect()` method is separate, so it can very, very easily be unit tested. Also, note how the "updated" criteria changes based on the input:

```java
@Repository
public class FooRepository {
    
	public Select createSelect(String parentId, Date before, Date after, String filter, String order, boolean asc, int offset, int max) {

		Select s = new MysqlStatementBuilder().createSelect();
		TableReference tr = s.fromTable(Foo.class);

		if(parentId!=null) {
			s.condition(Operator.AND, tr.field("parent_id"),Comparator.EQ,tr.value(parentId));
		}
		
		if(before==null && after==null) {
			// nothing
		} else if (before == null) {
			s.condition(Operator.AND, tr.field("updated"), Comparator.GTE, tr.value(after));
		} else if (after == null) {
			s.condition(Operator.AND, tr.field("updated"), Comparator.LTE, tr.value(before));
		} else if (after.before(before)) {
			// BETWEEN
			s.condition(Operator.AND, tr.field("updated"),Comparator.GTE, tr.value(after));
			s.condition(Operator.AND, tr.field("updated"),Comparator.LTE, tr.value(before));
		} else {
			// before a OR after b
			Condition c = s.condition(Operator.AND);
			c.condition(Operator.OR, tr.field("updated"),Comparator.GTE, tr.value(after));
			c.condition(Operator.OR, tr.field("updated"),Comparator.LTE, tr.value(before));
		}

		s.order(tr.field(order), asc);
		
		s.limit(offset, max);
		
		return s;

	}

	public List<Foo> list(String parentId, Date before, Date after, String filter, String order, boolean asc, int offset, int max) throws SqlException {
		Select s = createSelect(parentId,before,after,filter,order,asc,offset,max);
		return find(s.getSql(),s.getParams());
	}
    
}
```
